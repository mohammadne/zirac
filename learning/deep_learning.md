# Deep Learning

Neural networks
CNNs
RNNs
Transformers
Feedforward Neural Networks
Backpropagation & gradient descent
CNNs (images)
RNNs / LSTMs (sequences)
Transformers (foundation of modern AI)
Attention mechanisms

PyTorch (preferred for flexibility)
TensorFlow/Keras (for quicker prototyping)
Google Colab for free GPU compute
