# Generative AI

Diffusion models
large language models (LLMs)
fine-tuning
prompt engineering
How GPT-style LLMs are trained (transformer architecture, self-attention)
Fine-tuning vs LoRA vs RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
Diffusion models (e.g., Stable Diffusion)
Embeddings, tokenization, vector databases (FAISS, Chroma, Pinecone)
