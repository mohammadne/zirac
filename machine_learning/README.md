# Machine Learning

## Topics

- Regression
- classification
- trees
- clustering
- feature engineering.
- Supervised learning (linear/logistic regression, SVM)
- Decision trees, random forests
- Clustering (k-means)
- Overfitting, regularization
- Cross-validation, evaluation metrics
- Feature scaling, encoding

## Tools

Python (you can keep using Go for backend; ML is mostly in Python)
NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn
